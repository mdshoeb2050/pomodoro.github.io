## Pamodoro Clock Timer

> Pamodoro timer is one of the examples to exercise your javascript skills. So, for this challenge I build one that contains audio effects, start pause and stop button, functionality and audio controls.



> Things I learned in this project;
  * How to create two alternating timers in javascript.
  * Enhance my javascript knowledge in `setIntervals()` and `clearIntervals()`.
  * How to play audio when events are triggered.
  * How to add css animations.
